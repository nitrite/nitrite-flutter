## Contributing to the Nitrite Database

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Nitrite Database.

We are building this software together and strongly encourage contributions from the community that are within the guidelines set forth 
below. 

Bug Fixes and New Features
--------------------------

Before starting to write code, look for existing [issues](https://github.com/nitrite/nitrite-flutter/issues) or 
[create one](https://github.com/nitrite/nitrite-flutter/issues/new) for your bug, issue, or feature request. This helps the community 
avoid working on something that might not be of interest or which has already been addressed.

Pull Requests
-------------

Pull requests should generally be made against the main (default) branch and include relevant tests, if applicable. 

Code should compile and tests should pass. Currently Nitrite supports a minimum version of Flutter 3.  
Please run 'melos test' to confirm.

The results of pull request testing will be appended to the request. If any tests do not pass, or relevant tests are not included, the pull request will not be considered.
